# Conversational-RAG-With-PDF-Uploads-Chat-History
A Streamlit-based Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload PDFs and interact with their content using a chat interface. This project leverages LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace Embeddings, and Groq LLM (Gemma2-9b-It) to provide context-aware Q&amp;A while maintaining chat history.
